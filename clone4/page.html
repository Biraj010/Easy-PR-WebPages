              When Jennifer Chilton and Graeme Thirde were looking at nurseries
              for their eldest daughter, Imogen, they quickly realised that the
              traditional approach to early education wasn’t for them. “We
              didn’t want her to be stuck indoors all the time,” says Chilton,
              an IT consultant from London.

              “We wanted her to be able to run around outside and climb and
              develop confidence in her body and the way it interacts with her
              surroundings.”

              Finding a nursery called Little Forest Folk, which encourages
              children to learn by immersing themselves in the outdoors, was the
              first step on a path to the family reconnecting with the natural
              world on a more meaningful level.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Imogen, now seven, and her sister Florence, six, have continued
              their outdoor education at an independent primary school set in
              three acres of beautiful National Trust grounds. “We wanted to go
              back to basics with the way we raise our kids,” says Chilton.
              “When we were young, we were always outdoors, but most children
              today no longer have that opportunity.”
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
              For all four family members, this desire to live closer to nature
              is reflected in their choice of footwear. “We all wear
              Vivobarefoot shoes and absolutely love them,” says Thirde, who
              spent nine years in the army before retraining as a garden
              designer. “When you’re wearing them, you’re experiencing a
              connection with the ground the way we were intended to.”
            </p>

                no seams, no pressure points, and they can wear them all day –
                she loves them.”

              Beyond that, knowing their daughters’ feet aren’t being
              constrained by their shoes as they run, climb and play amid trees,
              fields and wildlife at the school they attend fits in with Chilton
              and Thirde’s philosophy of how they want their daughters to grow
              up.

            they’re in a different space mentally, which they usually find means

            Before he tried his first pair of Vivobarefoot shoes, Hutchins says
            he’d never considered the impact of traditional shoes on our feet.
            But once he did, the revelation was instant. “I realised that we’ve
            been lessening our connection with nature all this time, as well as
            deforming our feet and those of our children,” he says.
